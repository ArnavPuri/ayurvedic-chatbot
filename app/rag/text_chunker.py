    Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. It was developed more than 3,000 years ago in India.
    
    It's based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Its main goal is to promote good health, not fight disease. But treatments may be geared toward specific health problems.
    
    According to Ayurveda, everything in the universe â€“ dead or alive â€“ is connected. If your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When something disrupts this balance, you get sick.
    
    Among the things that can upset this balance are genetic or birth defects, injuries, climate and seasonal change, age, and your emotions. Those who practice Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air, fire, water, and earth.
    
    These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. They control how your body works. The three doshas are Vata dosha (space and air), Pitta dosha (fire and water), and Kapha dosha (water and earth).
